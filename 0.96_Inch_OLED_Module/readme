#Description: 
These displays are small, only about 1" diameter, but very readable due to the high contrast of an OLED display. 
This display is made of 128x64 individual yellow and blue OLED pixels, each one is turned on or off by the controller chip.
Because the display makes its own light, no backlight is required. 
This reduces the power required to run the OLED.
This breakout can be used with either an SPI interface
The design is completely 3.3V-ready, with an onboard regulator and built in boost converter.
The SSD1306 embeds with contrast control, display RAM and oscillator, which reduces the number of
external components and power consumption. 
It has 256-step brightness control.
it supports Raspberry Pi A, A+,B,B+,2B,3B.
