#RPI 16x2 LCD+Keypad Kit SKU:Z-0019
It's a LCD display which can show two lines and 16 characters on it. and it easy to use a blue and white 16x2 Character LCD.
It's based on I2c protocol and it can communicate with your Pi with less wire. 
With this in mind, we wanted to make it easier for people to get these LCD into their projects so we devised a Pi plate that lets you control a 16x2 Character LCD,
up to 3 led pins(rgb led) AND 5 keypad pins using only the two I2C pins on the R-Pi! 
The best part is you don't really lose those two pins either, since you can stick i2c-based sensors, RTCs, etc and have them share the I2C bus.
This is a super slick way to add a display without all the wiring hassle. This pi plate is perfect for when you want to build a stand-alone project with its own user interface. 
The 4 directional buttons plus select button allows basic control without having to attach a bulky computer.
The plate is designed for both Revision 1 and Revision 2 Raspberry Pi's. It uses the I2C (SDA/SCL) pins. 
To keep them from shorting against the metal, a piece of electrical tape must be placed onto the USB ports.
Attention:due to the new version of MCP23017, may not support the extended pull-up resistor on the IO.and LCD16x2+Keypad not support for Pi 3.
Setup your Pi with I2C tool.
